# AvatarBuilder
Introduce an app for the creation of your personal avatar. The app allows you to share the avatar between your phone and AppWatch. Make changes on your phone or on your AppWatch affects the data for both devices.
The project includes an app for iOS and an app for watchOS.
Supporting platforms: iPhone - requires iOS 16 or later, Apple Watch - requires watchOS 9.0 or later.
Tech stack used: iOS APP - UIKit, MVP, Combine, WatchConnectivity; WatchOS APP - SwiftUI, Combine, MMVVM, WatchConnectivity.

Possible problems:
There are no validators for text data, but if needed, it's no big deal to be implemented.
!!! Both apps have been tested using xcode environment and simulators only. It still need to be tested onn the real devices.

P.S.: Thank you for taking the time to familiarize yourself with my project. I appreciate your interest and the effort you put into understanding it."
